Welcome to the public beta test of the new Cryptomator for iOS app! This new app is fully integrated into the Files app of iOS.

Keep in mind that this is a pre-release version intended for testing and that some features like auto-lock are still missing. Check out our open-source repository on GitHub: https://github.com/cryptomator/ios

We're looking forward to your feedback!

## Changes Since 2.0.0 Beta 2
- Added "unlock vault" in Files app, incl. support for Touch ID / Face ID (#10, #59)
- Added vault detail screen, incl. "lock vault" (#5, #69)
- Fixed support for external drives via "Other File Provider" (#63)
- Fixed links in "About Cryptomator" screen

Be aware that with this update, you have to set up your vaults again. This will happen during the beta from time to time, probably more often in the beginning. Sorry for the inconvenience that this may cause.
