Welcome to the public beta test of the new Cryptomator for iOS app! This new app is fully integrated into the Files app of iOS.

Keep in mind that this is a pre-release version intended for testing and that some features like auto-lock are still missing. Check out our open-source repository on GitHub: https://github.com/cryptomator/ios

We're looking forward to your feedback!

## Changes Since 2.0.0 Beta 4
- Added Czech translation
- Fixed unshown password screen on iOS 15 (#81)
- Fixed wrong password being potentially stored in keychain for Touch ID / Face ID
- Improved logging and WebDAV error messages

Be aware that with this update, you may have to set up your vaults again. This will happen during the beta from time to time, probably more often in the beginning. Sorry for the inconvenience that this may cause.
