This will probably be the last public beta version before the release of the new Cryptomator for iOS app in the App Store!

Feel free to also test the in-app purchases in this TestFlight version. If you're not already familiar with it, this _will not_ trigger actual purchases.

We're looking forward to your feedback! Check out our open-source repository on GitHub: https://github.com/cryptomator/ios
