Welcome to the public beta test of the new Cryptomator for iOS app! This new app is fully integrated into the Files app of iOS.

Keep in mind that this is a pre-release version intended for testing and that some features like auto-lock are still missing. Check out our open-source repository on GitHub: https://github.com/cryptomator/ios

We're looking forward to your feedback!
