Welcome to the first alpha version of the new Cryptomator for iOS app!

This new app is fully integrated into the Files app.

Be aware that a lot of things aren't working yet. E.g., you can't create a new vault yet. Make sure to create a new vault with our other apps so that you can add an existing vault.

We're looking forward to your feedback!
